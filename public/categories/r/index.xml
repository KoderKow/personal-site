      <description>For the past year I have had the pleasure of working with the data visualization team at IUPUI. I approached Professor Reda looking to explore the realm of research. He gave me the opportunity to sit in their team meetings for the spring semester. As fall came around I joined the team.

As the years go on death rates are doubling from the abuse of opioids. Heroin overdoses continue to rise and now fentanyl is joining its ranks. Fentanyl has been getting mixed with heroin to increase its potency and in return it increases the chance of overdosing (Rondinone, 2017).</description>
